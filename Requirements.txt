Stripe integration
* Users should have stripe customer token in the users table
* Javascript should prevent pro form from submiting after user fills it out,
and should send card info to stripe. Stripe will return with card token.
* Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app
should validate the user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token
to stripe server and stripe will create a subscription and send back customer
token. Rails should save customer token and user info to our database
